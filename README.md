# NBA-Playoffs-Outcome-Prediction
By James Weaver

Project: "Data_Science_KNN_Project.pdf"

# Introduction
Performed exploratory data analysis on the NBA playoffs dataset utilizing summary statistics, histograms, scatter,
and box plots to identify variable distributions, significance, and correlations. Also developed a KNN model to predict the outcomes of the NBA playoffs.

# Files
The "Data_Science_KNN_Project.pdf" represents a comprehensive documentation of a project that delved into the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, a cornerstone in machine learning. Diving deeper, "Project2 Data Science-Copy1.ipynb" is an interactive Jupyter Notebook that showcases the data science workflow, from initial data exploration to model deployment, using Python. This notebook was further distilled into the "Project2 Data Science-Copy2.pdf", which provides a more streamlined view suitable for quick referencing. Lastly, the "Project2 Data Science-Copy2.py" is a versatile Python script derived from the notebook, facilitating more direct implementations of the techniques demonstrated in the project. The file folder contains the datasets that were used.

# Analysis
- Wrangled data through encoding, outlier detection, and imputation to ensure data quality.
- Applied borderline SMOTE to improve the class imbalance of target variables, enhancing model performance.
- Grid searched stratified K-Fold CV KNN model parameters to achieve an optimal F1 score of 0.8 while avoiding
model overfit to training data.
